          <h2>Site Description</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of Huckleberry Weather is to give
            up to date weather for the small Idaho towns of Preston,
            Soda Springs, and Fish Haven. 
            Site visitors can view the weather forecast, 
            a photo gallery, and a storm center for large storm fronts
            coming to the area.
            Site visitors can check basic information such as the current temperature and 
            weather forecast, and they can also get information on the air quality in their area. 
            Weather photos from site users can be viewed in a gallery to see the weather events 
            that have happened recently in their area.
            A storm center page is part of the site so that users can visit a focused area 
            to receive updated information on any large storms coming into the area that might 
            affect their safety or activities for the day.

          <h2>Site Name</h2>
          <p>
            The home page address for Huckleberry Weather is huckleberryweather.com.<br>
             It is available through <a id="link1" href="https://domains.google.com">Google Domains</a> for $12 per year.
          </p>
          <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
          <p>Huckleberry Weather's purpose is to bring weather forecasts to 
            rural Idaho. Small towns are often left out of weather forcasts done by 
            large stations who mainly focus on big cities.
            Small towns deserve to have up to date weather predictions, so Huckleberry Weather's 
            purpose is to fill this gap.
